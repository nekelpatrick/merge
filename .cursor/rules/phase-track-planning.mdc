# Phase-Track Planning Methodology

## MANDATORY: Before implementing ANY feature or change, you MUST:

1. **Check existing Track Prompts** in `Assets/Documentation/TrackPrompts/`
2. **Identify which track owns the files** you need to modify
3. **Follow the track's defined scope and constraints**
4. **Plan work according to the Phase-Track-Agent model**

---

## Track Documentation Reference

Before starting work, ALWAYS read the relevant track prompt:

| Track | File | Domain |
|-------|------|--------|
| A | `Phase3_TrackA_VisualPrimitives.md` | 3D visuals, VFX, primitives |
| B | `Phase3_TrackB_SceneAtmosphere.md` | Lighting, fog, post-processing, ground |
| C | `Phase3_TrackC_BattleScenarios.md` | Scenarios, waves, difficulty |
| D | `Phase3_TrackD_Audio.md` | Sound effects, music, AudioManager |
| E | `Phase3_TrackE_Tutorial.md` | Tutorial hints, onboarding |
| F | `Phase3_TrackF_Menus.md` | MainMenu, pause, scene loading |
| G | `Phase3_TrackG_EditorAutomation.md` | Editor scripts, setup automation |

---

## Planning Rules

### 1. ALWAYS Identify Track Ownership First

Before modifying ANY file, determine which track owns it:

```
Scripts/Visual/*        → Track A
Scripts/Audio/*         → Track D  
Scripts/Tutorial/*      → Track E
Scripts/UI/Menu*.cs     → Track F
Scripts/UI/Tutorial*.cs → Track E
Scripts/Data/*Scenario* → Track C
Scripts/Data/*Wave*     → Track C
Editor/*Setup*.cs       → Track G
ScriptableObjects/Scenarios/* → Track C
ScriptableObjects/Waves/*     → Track C
ScriptableObjects/Tutorial/*  → Track E
Scenes/MainMenu*        → Track F
Art/Materials/*         → Track B
Settings/*Volume*       → Track B
```

### 2. NEVER Cross Track Boundaries Without Justification

- If you need to modify files from MULTIPLE tracks, you MUST:
  1. Explicitly state which tracks are affected
  2. Explain why cross-track modification is necessary
  3. Prefer using `GameEvents` for cross-track communication

### 3. Follow Track Prompt Structure

Each track prompt contains:
- **Scope** - Exact files to create/modify
- **Success Criteria** - What must work when complete
- **Constraints** - What NOT to touch
- **Dependencies** - What must exist before starting
- **Test Steps** - How to verify it works

### 4. Plan BEFORE Implementing

When the user asks for a new feature or change:

```markdown
## Planning Phase

1. **Feature Analysis**
   - What is being requested?
   - Which tracks does this affect?

2. **Track Identification**
   - Primary track: [A-G]
   - Secondary tracks (if any): [list]

3. **File Scope**
   - Files to create: [list]
   - Files to modify: [list]
   - Files NOT to touch: [list]

4. **Implementation Order**
   - Step 1: [task]
   - Step 2: [task]
   ...

5. **Success Criteria**
   - [ ] Criterion 1
   - [ ] Criterion 2
```

---

## Integration Points

All tracks communicate via `GameEvents.cs`. NEVER add direct references between track systems.

### Available Events (use these for cross-track communication):

```csharp
// Dice System
OnDiceRolled, OnDieLockToggled, OnAvailableActionsChanged

// Combat  
OnEnemyWaveSpawned, OnEnemyKilled, OnAttackBlocked, OnAttackLanded

// Shield Wall
OnBrotherWounded, OnBrotherDied, OnWallIntegrityChanged

// Player
OnStaminaChanged, OnPlayerWounded

// Turn Flow
OnPhaseChanged, OnWaveStarted, OnWaveCleared, OnBattleEnded
```

---

## When Creating NEW Features

If a feature doesn't fit existing tracks:

1. **Check if it's an extension of existing track** → Add to that track
2. **Check if it's truly new domain** → Create new track prompt
3. **Document the new track** in `Assets/Documentation/TrackPrompts/`

### New Track Prompt Template

```markdown
# Phase N: Track [X] - [Name]

## Overview
[What this track delivers]

## Scope
### Files to Create
- `path/to/file.cs` - Description

### Files to Modify  
- `path/to/existing.cs` - What changes

### Files NOT to Touch
- List files owned by other tracks

## Dependencies
- Requires Track [X] complete
- Requires [component] to exist

## Implementation Tasks
### X1: [Task name]
[Details]

### X2: [Task name]
[Details]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Test Steps
1. Open [scene]
2. Press Play
3. Verify [behavior]
```

---

## Quick Reference Commands

When asked to implement something, respond with:

1. "Let me check the track documentation..."
2. Read relevant `Assets/Documentation/TrackPrompts/*.md` file
3. "This belongs to Track [X]. The track defines [scope]."
4. Present plan following track structure
5. Implement according to plan

---

## Examples

### Good: Track-Aware Planning

**User:** "Add screen shake when player takes damage"

**Agent Response:**
> Let me check the track documentation...
> 
> This belongs to **Track A (Visual Primitives)** - specifically `ScreenEffectsController.cs`.
> 
> **Plan:**
> 1. Track A owns `Scripts/Visual/ScreenEffectsController.cs`
> 2. Subscribe to `GameEvents.OnPlayerWounded`
> 3. Add `TriggerScreenShake()` method
> 4. No cross-track files needed
>
> **Implementing Track A scope only...**

### Bad: Ignoring Track Ownership

**User:** "Add screen shake when player takes damage"

**Agent Response:**
> I'll add a screen shake effect...
> *[Modifies random files without checking track ownership]*
> *[Creates new file in wrong folder]*
> *[Adds direct reference instead of using events]*

---

## Enforcement

This rule is **ALWAYS APPLIED**. When planning any feature:

1. ✅ DO read track documentation first
2. ✅ DO identify track ownership
3. ✅ DO follow track scope constraints
4. ✅ DO use GameEvents for cross-track communication
5. ❌ DON'T modify files outside your track scope
6. ❌ DON'T skip the planning phase
7. ❌ DON'T add direct references between track systems

## Step 1: Create Phase Document

A **Phase** represents a major milestone in development (e.g., "Greybox Prototype", "Content + Polish", "Visual Style").

### Phase Document Structure

```markdown
# Phase N: [Name]

## Overview
- What this phase delivers
- High-level goals

## Architecture Diagram
- Mermaid flowcharts showing system relationships
- Event flow between components

## Track A: [Feature Area]
### A1: Specific task
### A2: Specific task
...

## Track B: [Feature Area]
...

## Implementation Order
| Step | Track | Deliverable | Dependencies |

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Checkbox list of must-have features
```

### Key Principles for Phase Documents

1. **Self-contained** - Each phase doc has all context needed
2. **Dependency-aware** - Implementation order considers what depends on what
3. **Testable** - Success criteria are concrete and verifiable
4. **Architecture-first** - Diagrams before code

---

## Step 2: Design Independent Tracks

**Tracks** are parallel workstreams that can be developed independently with minimal merge conflicts.

### Track Design Rules

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| **One folder/domain per track** | Avoids file conflicts |
| **No cross-track dependencies within phase** | Enables parallel work |
| **Clear interfaces** | Tracks communicate via events, not direct references |
| **Numbered sub-tasks (A1, A2...)** | Preserves implementation order within track |

### Example Track Breakdown (Phase 3)

| Track | Domain | Files Modified |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| A | 3D Visual Primitives | `Scripts/Visual/*` |
| B | Scene Atmosphere | `Editor/BattleSceneSetup.cs`, Lighting |
| C | Battle Scenarios | `Scripts/Data/`, `ScriptableObjects/Scenarios/` |
| D | Audio Integration | `Scripts/Audio/`, `Audio/*` |
| E | Tutorial System | `Scripts/Tutorial/`, `Scripts/UI/TutorialHintUI.cs` |
| F | Menus | `Scenes/MainMenu.unity`, `Scripts/UI/Menu*.cs` |
| G | Editor Automation | `Editor/*.cs` |

### Avoiding Conflicts

- Tracks should NOT modify the same files
- If shared file must be touched (e.g., `router.go`), designate ONE track as owner
- Use events/interfaces for cross-track communication
- Integration happens AFTER tracks complete

---

## Step 3: Assign Tracks to Agents

Each **Track** is given to a separate AI agent session for implementation.

### Agent Assignment Protocol

1. **Open new agent session** (new chat/context)
2. **Provide context:**
   - Full phase document
   - Specific track assignment (e.g., "Implement Track A only")
   - Existing codebase patterns (via `.cursorrules` or workspace rules)
3. **Agent works independently** on assigned track
4. **Agent commits/PRs** when track complete

### Agent Instructions Template

```
You are implementing Track [X] of Phase [N].

## Your Scope
- [List of files to create/modify]
- [Specific tasks A1, A2, etc.]

## DO NOT TOUCH
- Files owned by other tracks
- Core systems unless explicitly listed

## Integration Points
- Subscribe to these events: [list]
- Fire these events: [list]

## When Complete
- All tasks A1-An implemented
- No compiler errors
- Manual test: [specific test steps]
```

---

## Step 4: Merge & Integrate

After all tracks complete, integration phase begins.

### Integration Checklist

1. **Merge all track branches** (resolve any conflicts)
2. **Verify event wiring** - Do systems respond to each other?
3. **Run full test suite** - Unit + Integration
4. **Manual playtest** - Success criteria from phase doc
5. **Fix integration bugs** - Often cross-track communication issues

### Common Integration Issues

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Events not firing | Subscriber not registered | Check `OnEnable`/`OnDisable` |
| Null references | Initialization order | Use `Awake` for refs, `Start` for deps |
| Missing assets | Track created but didn't commit | Check `.meta` files |
| Scene not updated | Track modified prefab, not scene | Re-add prefabs to scene |

---

## Benefits of This Approach

### Parallelization
- N agents working simultaneously = N× throughput
- No waiting for one feature to complete before starting another

### Reduced Context Switching
- Each agent focuses on ONE domain
- Deep understanding of assigned track

### Minimized Conflicts
- Tracks own specific folders/files
- Git merges are clean

### Clear Accountability
- Each track has defined deliverables
- Easy to identify which track caused issues

### Scalable
- Add more tracks = add more agents
- Works for solo dev (sequential) or team (parallel)

---

## When NOT to Use This Approach

| Scenario | Why Not | Alternative |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Tightly coupled refactor | Everything touches everything | Single agent, sequential |
| Exploration/prototyping | Scope unclear | Single agent, iterative |
| Bug fixing | Often cross-cutting | Single agent with full context |
| Small features | Overhead not worth it | Just do it |
